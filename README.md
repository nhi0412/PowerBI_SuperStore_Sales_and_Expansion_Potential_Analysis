# PowerBI_SuperStore_Sales_and_Expansion_Potential_Analysis

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

Senior Managers need real-time insights into business performance to identify trends, optimize product strategies, and expand into profitable markets. This project aims to build a Power BI dashboard that consolidates key business metrics, helping stakeholders track performance, detect issues, and make informed strategic decisions.

## **2. Introduction to Dataset**

The dataset consists of three tables that provide insights into order details, sales person, and returned orders:

1. Orders Table (Fact Table) – Contains product details, including order date, product, sales amount, profit, and customer information.
2. People Table (Dimension Table) – Stores details of sales representatives and their assigned regions.
3. Returns Table (Fact Table) – Records orders that were returned, helping analyze return rates and product performance.

## **3. Business Questions**

To help Senior Managers make strategic decisions, the dashboard will address key business questions:

1. **Sales Performance** – Which regions and products drive the most revenue and profit?
2. **Market Expansion** – Where are the best opportunities for business growth?
3. **Product Strategy** – What are the top-performing products?
4. **Return Analysis** – Which products have high return rates?
5. **Sales Team Efficiency** – Which sales representatives contribute the most to company success?

## 6. Insights

### **Sales, Profit & Returns Trends**

- Sales and profit have been increasing, with their trends closely aligned, indicating consistent revenue growth.
- However, the return rate (12.18%) is higher than the profit margin (11.6%), signaling potential issues in product quality or customer satisfaction.
- Sales and returns follow a similar pattern, which may indicate that high-selling products also have a high likelihood of being returned.

### **Revenue & Quantity Breakdown**

- Revenue by Category:
    - Technology generates the highest revenue and profit, making it a key driver of business growth.
    - Furniture has the lowest profit, while Office Supplies has the lowest revenue despite its high sales volume.
- Quantity by Segment:
    - Office Supplies is the highest-selling category across all customer segments.
    - Furniture remains the least purchased category, impacting its revenue contribution.
- Top 10 Sub-Categories (by Quantity Sold):
    - Art, Binders, Chairs, Paper, and Storage rank highest in quantity sold, highlighting consistent demand.

### **Regional & Market Performance**

- The US is the dominant market, contributing the most revenue and orders.
- Top revenue-generating markets: APAC, EU, US, and LATAM.
- Top 5 countries by order volume: US, Australia, Mexico, France, and China.
- Profit margin varies significantly by region:
    - Canada has the highest profit margin.
    - Southeast Asia has the lowest profit margin, indicating pricing or cost challenges in this region.

### **Shipping & Logistics Trends**

- Nearly 60% of orders are shipped via Standard Class, showing customer preference for cost-effective delivery.
- Same Day shipping has the lowest adoption, likely due to higher costs.

- Adjust pricing strategies in low-margin markets like Southeast Asia to improve profitability.
- Bundle Furniture with high-demand categories like Technology to improve its sales performance and profitability.

### **Targeted Product & Segment Strategies**

- Increase marketing and promotions for high-performing categories (Technology in APAC, Office Supplies in the EU).
- Re-evaluate pricing for low-revenue categories (Office Supplies) to ensure better profitability.
- Identify slow-moving subcategories and introduce discounts, bundling, or clearance strategies.

### **Improve Shipping Strategy & Logistics**

- Optimize Standard Class shipping costs to increase margins while maintaining customer preference.
- Offer incentives for Same Day shipping to encourage adoption and drive profitability in urgent orders.

### **Strengthen Sales & Regional Market Expansion**

- Leverage the expertise of top sales reps (Anna & Chuck) to train and mentor other team members.
- Expand promotions in high-performing regions (US, APAC, EU, LATAM) to sustain revenue growth.
- Identify strategies to improve Southeast Asia’s profit margin, potentially through local partnerships or cost adjustments.
